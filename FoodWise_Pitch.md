*Transforming Food Waste into Hope Through Community-Driven Technology*

## 🔴 The Problem

**40% of food produced globally is wasted** while **828 million people go hungry every day.**

### The Reality:
- **Restaurants** throw away tons of perfectly edible food daily
- **Wedding venues** discard food meant for 500+ guests after events
- **Catering companies** struggle with surplus from cancelled orders
- **NGOs and food banks** lack real-time coordination systems
- **Good Samaritans** want to help but don't know how to connect

**The gap isn't food shortage—it's coordination.**
